# 364Days

> An experiment attempting to make the impossible *possible*.
>> A N64 emulator for the N3DS/N2DS.

The Nintendo N3DS homebrew scene is clearly lacking in development, due to the recent takeover of the Nintendo Switch. Many people have claimed to have a working N64 emulator for the 3DS, but either failed to provide information, proof, or any sort of accomplishment of the task at hand.

I want to change that.

### Disclaimer

I am not, in anyway, making promises on progress, a working emulator, or a successful release. The N64 by itself is a complex system to emulate due to the nature of the console, generally requiring more than a standard 3DS can offer in terms of computing power. On top of that, I don't have a huge amount of time to dedicate to this project, but I will be doing my best.

### About

364Days is an HLE emulator.
The focus is to get some of the more popular titles running, however, a majority of testing will be done with demo roms grabbed  from [here](https://www.pouet.net) and other sources. It will most likely only be able to run on New Nintendo 3DS/2DS models, as the N64 requires more ram than the SNES would, and Nintendo's SNES Virtual Console emulates only on newer systems. The 3D graphics within a majority of N64 games most likely won't be anything decent for a long time to come. I'm starting work on the emulator in Java, and as I learn more C++, will eventually translate it into that. When the time comes for a release, there will be an announcement posted in the discord (if someone wants to open other social media accounts for the project, email me), as well as a .3dsx file under releases. A .cia file will not be in the works until I can guarantee that the emulator has a decent GUI and a save system, which then releases will have both. Most of the work will be done on weekends, as I am a student and need to focus on school during the week.
**Development will be slow.**

Work started on 3/2/18.
