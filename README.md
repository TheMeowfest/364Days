>> A N64 emulator for the N3DS/N2DS.

The Nintendo N3DS homebrew scene is clearly lacking in development, due to the recent takeover of the Nintendo Switch. Many people have claimed to have a working N64 emulator for the 3DS, but either failed to provide information, proof, or any sort of accomplishment of the task at hand.

I want to change that.

### Disclaimer

I am not, in anyway, making promises on progress, a working emulator, or a successful release. The N64 by itself is a complex system to emulate due to the nature of the console, generally requiring more than a standard 3DS can offer in terms of computing power. On top of that, I don't have a huge amount of time to dedicate to this project, but I will be doing my best.
