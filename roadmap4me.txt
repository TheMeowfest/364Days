learn the systems

1. load file - var
2. read file - token()
3. reasearch N64 system (cpu, ram)(boot sequencing)(n64.icequake.net)(cart start & stop)
4. onlinedisassembler.com
4. dd conv=swab if=rom of=outputrom
4. look for cpu architecture instruction (datasheet)(datasheets.chipdb.org)
5. hex -> binary (match binary in cpu)
6. memory map
7. emulators (mupen64, pj64, CTR64, cen64)
7. research circumvention of bios
8. start looking at power on
-32bit = 32 stuff
-64 bit = 64 stuff
9. CPU Registers - vars
-Big Endian
10. UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CPU (what writes where, when, what, how, etc.)(be specific)
